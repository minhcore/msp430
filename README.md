# MSP430 

This is a personal repository used to store my code and drivers for the MSP430G2553 microcontroller.

## What is inside?
- **Drivers**: Hardware drivers written from scratch for the MSP430G2553.
- **Code**: General snippets and experiment logic.
- **Notes**: My learning materials.

## Credits & References

Most of the concepts, project structure, and parts of the implementation in this repository are heavily inspired by the work of Niklas (Artful Bytes).

This repository is maintained by me for learning purposes.
I study, modify, and gradually rewrite components to deepen my understanding of MSP430 internals.
